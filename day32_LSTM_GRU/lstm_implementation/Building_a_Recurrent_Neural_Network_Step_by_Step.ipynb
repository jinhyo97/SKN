    "# Building your Recurrent Neural Network - Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Course 5's first assignment, where you'll be implementing key components of a Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN, in NumPy! \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define notation for building sequence models\n",
    "* Describe the architecture of a basic RNN\n",
    "* Identify the main components of an LSTM\n",
    "* Implement backpropagation through time for a basic RNN and an LSTM\n",
    "* Give examples of several types of RNN \n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory.\" They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some contextual information through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time step to the next. This allows a unidirectional (one-way) RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirectional (two-way) RNN can take context from both the past and the future, much like Marty McFly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation**:\n",
    "- Superscript $[l]$ denotes an object associated with the $l^{th}$ layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $(i)$ denotes an object associated with the $i^{th}$ example. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $\\langle t \\rangle$ denotes an object at the $t^{th}$ time \n",
    "step. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Subscript $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- $a^{(2)[3]<4>}_5$ denotes the activation of the 2nd training example (2), 3rd layer [3], 4th time step <4>, and 5th entry in the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-requisites\n",
    "* You should already be familiar with `numpy`\n",
    "* To refresh your knowledge of numpy, you can review course 1 of the specialization \"Neural Networks and Deep Learning\":\n",
    "    * Specifically, review the week 2's practice assignment [\"Python Basics with Numpy (optional assignment)\"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/programming/isoAV/python-basics-with-numpy)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Be careful when modifying the starter code!\n",
    "* When working on graded functions, please remember to only modify the code that is between:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "#### START CODE HERE\n",
    "```\n",
    "and:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "#### END CODE HERE\n",
    "```\n",
    "* In particular, avoid modifying the first line of graded routines. These start with:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# GRADED FUNCTION: routine_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "The automatic grader (autograder) needs these to locate the function - so even a change in spacing will cause issues with the autograder, returning 'failed' if any of these are modified or missing. Now, let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader Error: Grader feedback not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/supplement/qHIve/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace)."

    "* An LSTM is similar to an RNN in that they both use hidden states to pass along information, but an LSTM also uses a cell state, which is like a long-term memory, to help deal with the issue of vanishing gradients\n",

    "    * A <b>forget</b> gate, which decides which input units should be remembered and passed along. It's a tensor with values between 0 and 1. \n",
    "        * If a unit has a value close to 0, the LSTM will \"forget\" the stored state in the previous cell state.\n",
    "        * If it has a value close to 1, the LSTM will mostly remember the corresponding value.\n",
    "    * An <b>update</b> gate, again a tensor containing values between 0 and 1. It decides on what information to throw away, and what new information to add.\n",
    "        * When a unit in the update gate is close to 1, the value of its candidate is passed on to the hidden state.\n",
    "        * When a unit in the update gate is close to 0, it's prevented from being passed onto the hidden state.\n",
